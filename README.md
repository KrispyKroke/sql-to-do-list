# SQL To-Do List


## Description

For this project, I designed a Full-Stack To-Do List web application.  I used SQL to design a database for storage of each task.  On the back-end, I used SQL queries to implement a GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT request.  I made complementary ajax requests for each of those requests on the front-end.  
The final product allowed a user to add a task, show all tasks on the DOM, toggle a task from complete to incomplete, and delete a task from their list.  I used styling to make the page more appealing to users and also visually show when a task is complete.
