# SQL To-Do List


# Description

Duration: 2-3 days

For this project, I designed a Full-Stack To-Do List web application.  I used SQL to design a database for storage of each task.  On the back-end, I used SQL queries to implement a GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT request.  I made complementary ajax requests for each of those requests on the front-end.  



The final product allowed a user to add a task, show all tasks on the DOM, toggle a task from complete to incomplete, and delete a task from their list.  I used styling to make the page more appealing to users and also visually show when a task is complete.

## List with 3 Tasks

Below is a screenshot of the list with 3 tasks already added.  Each task is incomplete.  The user can add additional tasks or delete existing tasks as well.
